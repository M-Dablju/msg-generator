# Message Generator

My first Node.js project designed to generate randomized prompts to the console.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

## Usage

1. Start the generator by running the following command: node script.js
2. Every time you type above command, you will get a new randomized output.
3. Message outputs are made up of data stored in 3 different arrays (who, when, what)
